## Tasks List

1. Read the code base and try to Understand what's all there first
2. Read React Js Initial Project Boiler plate code
3. List Out Features to start working on it



### Example Workflow in a React Project
```
Starting a New Project:

sh
Copy code
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
Installing a New Dependency:

sh
Copy code
npm install axios
Running the Development Server:

sh
Copy code
npm start
Building the Project:

sh
Copy code
npm run build
Committing Changes:

Make sure to commit both package.json and package-lock.json after installing or updating dependencies.
sh
Copy code
git add package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m "Add axios dependency"
git push origin main
By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage package.json and package-lock.json in your React project, ensuring a smooth and consistent development experience.
```

### Using the ESLint CLI to Generate the Configuration
```
Install ESLint:

First, if you haven't already, install ESLint in your project:

sh
Copy code
npm install eslint --save-dev
Run the Initialization Command:

Use the ESLint CLI to generate a configuration file. The following command will prompt you with a series of questions to set up your configuration:

sh
Copy code
npx eslint --init
During the setup process, you'll be asked several questions about your coding style, the type of modules you use, and the environment in which your code runs (Node, browser, etc.). ESLint will then generate a configuration file based on your answers.

Rename or Create .eslintrc.cjs:

By default, ESLint might create a .eslintrc.json, .eslintrc.js, or .eslintrc.yaml file. If you specifically need a .eslintrc.cjs file (CommonJS format), you can rename the generated file to .eslintrc.cjs or manually create one with the necessary configuration.
